# QuickFixWrapper

The goal of this project is to detangle the Eclipse Quick Fix functionality from the IDE such that quick fix can be called on non-workspace objects. This is extremely useful for fixing code in batch. 

Updates to Eclipse Quickfix may break functionality. I have no intent to maintain this code. I hate eclipse.
